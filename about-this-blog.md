title: About This Blog
---

When it was first started, this blog was set-up as a way to track my progress in reading the [Maker's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse](/2016/05/31/the-makers-guide-to-the-zombie-apocalypse/) - providing a location for me to publish my musings as I work through building the projects contained within it.

But the deeper purpose of the blog was to learn how to become a _Maker_, specifically, learning the skills and techniques needed to produce physical items in the real world - so while I'm still following that initial goal, I've opened the scope of the blog to include all my maker projects.

This means in addition to [my Zombie Apocalypse posts](/tag/the-makers-guide-to-the-zombie-apocalypse/), you'll also find posts about [my progress with the Weekend Woodworker course](/tag/weekend-woodworker/), [my IoT-based project Wildcat](/tag/wildcat/), and [the silly things I build for Halloween](/tag/spooktober/) - among a whole bunch of other stuff.

In the spirit of full disclosure, this site uses affiliate links (where possible) when linking to the products and components I discuss. This means that I may get a commission if you decide to purchase anything via these links, which although minimal, will help me fund the project.

This isn’t a review site, and as a non-professional I’ll often not know exactly what I’m doing, but all the thoughts and opinions posted on this blog will be honest and off the cuff, so please keep this in mind should you choose to purchase anything I link to.
