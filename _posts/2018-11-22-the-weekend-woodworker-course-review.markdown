As anyone that follows this blog knows, I've slowly been working my way though [the Weekend Woodworker course](/tag/weekend-woodworker/) by Steve Ramsey.

I found the course enlightening and educational, as well as entertaining, so when I was given the opportunity to write a review of it for [HackSpace magazine](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/), I jumped at it - and today that review has been published in issue 13.

If you're not a subscriber to the magazine, you can [download the PDF edition for free from their site](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/13), although I personally find the dead tree edition much better, having been a subscriber since the first issue.

I hope you enjoy the review - feel free to [let me know what you think](https://twitter.com/limeblast) - &nbsp;and if you want more content like it, [subscribe to the blog](https://feedly.com/i/subscription/feed/https://maker.limeblast.co.uk/rss/).
