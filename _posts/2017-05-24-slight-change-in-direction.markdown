When I first started this blog it was designed as a repository of thoughts as I read though, and complete the projects within, [The Maker's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse](/about-the-book/).

I purchased the book because I was excited to use it as my route into the _maker_ scene, something which I was totally unaware of just before this time, and have been excited to learn more and more about ever since.

As it stands right now I've completed four (and a half) the twenty projects contained within the book, but have ground to a bit of a halt.

It's not that I'm not enjoying the book, or the projects within it, it's just that as I follow them, I find they're working towards a slightly different destination to the one I want to reach.

I'm also finding that a lot of the projects require resources that I simply don't have access to - at least for now.

Additionally, since starting this whole adventure, I've found a lot of other really cool resources for learning maker skills, and I've found myself drawn to them more than the book.

The ones which have excited me the most are the [classes over at Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/classes/). More than just teaching dry concepts and theory, these use practical projects as a method of learning, and at the end of it get to walk away with something cool to show your friends.

There are classes for topics as diverse as electronics, robotics, 3D printing, cooking, sewing, superhero costumes, et al, and I've joined far more of them than I have anywhere near enough time to complete, but I'm going to do my best.

With this in mind, and remembering the original goal of the blog, I've decided that I'm going to deemphasise the focus on the zombie book, and start making more posts about the other projects I'm working on as part of the Instructables classes - and anything else vaguely related to the maker scene.

My particular focus right now is their [Electronics Class](https://www.instructables.com/class/Electronics-Class/), for which I've been tasked to create a _mad scientists light_. It's taken me a while to acquire all the parts for this, but I have them now.

Watch this space.
