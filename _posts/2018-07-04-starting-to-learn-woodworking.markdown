For a craft where the principle material literally grows on trees, it's surprising just how expensive it is to get started in woodworking.

I've had an interest in learning woodworking for the past 2 or so years, born out of watching maker videos on YouTube by people like [Peter Brown](https://www.youtube.com/user/kludge1977) and [Steve Ramsey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBB7sYb14uBtk8UqSQYc9-w) (among many other quality channels).

I found it relaxing to watch a block of wood get turned on the lathe into into a bowl, or a stack of lumber cut, assembled, glued, and sanded into a side table. I also found it empowering to know that even these masters of their craft made mistakes, and rather than shy away from what they did wrong, instead share them with the viewers, and teach us how to overcome them.

So when the aforementioned Steve Ramsey had a father's day sale on his [Weekend Woodworker](https://theweekendwoodworker.com/) course a few weeks ago, I jumped at the opportunity to take advantage of my newly gained space, and signed up.

The course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of woodworking over the course of 6 weekend build projects, each consisting of two videos (one for Saturday, one for Sunday) showing, step by step, everything you need to do. I've watched a couple of the videos, to get an idea of what to expect, but before I can get started doing it myself I need some equipment.

One of the main selling points of the course is how cheap it is to buy all the equipment needed to complete it. You're presented with a list of the actual equipment Steve uses in the course, and all together they totalled just under $1000.

Now maybe $1000 _is_ cheap for a beginner woodworker, but it's a touch more than I was expecting, especially when you factor in the cost of the timber itself (which is a whole other issue, one which I'll post about another time) - but if this is the cost of admission, so be it.

I have a Bosch _Power For All 18v_ drill, and love the idea of working unconstrained by cords, so while I'm very possibly contradicting myself here, I figure it's worth the extra expense of expanding my Bosch collection with the cordless variants of their circular saw, impact driver, and random orbital sander. I also already have a jigsaw and shop vac from Aldi (and router, although this isn't required for the course), and was generously gifted an Evolution mitre saw for my birthday.

So throw in some clamps and other bits and pieces and I'll have enough to complete the first three projects, which I aim to do before it gets too cold to work outside.

So watch this space, as I hope it won't be long before I complete the introduction project - the Basic Mobile Workbench.
