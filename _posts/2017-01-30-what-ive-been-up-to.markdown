<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t's been a while since my last post, so I wanted to spend a moment talking about what I've been up to.</p>

In the first instance, I should probably talk about my progress in the book. Basically, I got to a point where it was becoming difficult to complete the projects without spending ever more money on things which would only ever serve the purpose of the book - that is, beyond constructing whatever gizmo the chapter asked for, and learning the small nugget of knowledge as a result, it was becoming difficult to justify the cost.

While I love the idea of the book, and really do want to complete the projects with it, it's becoming more and more evident that its focus is on scavaging components and survival in such a fictional universe (which, to be fair, is exactly what it says on the tin), but was starting to run contrary to the experience I wanted. This isn't the end of the story so far as this aspect of this blog is concerned, but completing the book may take longer than I initially expected.

Instead, I've been focusing on improving my non-zombie apocalypse maker skills.

This started off with a focus on my electronics knowledge, which I decided to enhance via two electronics courses I found: [Electronic Interfaces (EE40LX)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015/info) and [Pirate Electronics](http://pirateselectronics.teachable.com/).

Alas, these have both been put on the back burner, the first because it was WAY above my level of knowledge (basically, it was aimed at physics postgraduates), and the second because it was _slightly_ above my level. I don't think I'm ever going to understand the content in the first, but with a bit more experience and electronics knowledge from other sources, I think I'll be able to complete the second.

To this end, I'm currently half way through the [Electronics class over at Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/class/Electronics-Class/). Now, this is really good (although it's also turning out to be quite expensive buying all the materials and tools needed to complete the projects within it), it's really taking me out of my comfort zone, and I'm forcing me to learn new things. I'm going to make a couple of posts about this as they become relevant.

Also over at Instructables, I completed the [Arduino class](http://www.instructables.com/class/Arduino-Class/). This [let me build an infinity mirror](https://talk.birmingham.io/t/i-built-an-infinity-mirror/3059), something I've wanted to do for a long time.

Uumm, that's about it, for now.
