<p class="intro"><a href="http://amzn.to/1spRddk"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Maker's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse</a>, a book written by Simon Monk (who I gather is quite well known within the maker community, having <a href="http://amzn.to/1spRqwW">authored various books</a> on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi), is clearly something that knows how to motivate me.</p> 

Based around the idea that the zombie apocalypse is just around the corner, it uses that theme and setting to teach the basics of electronics, by showing you how to build a number of practical projects using components which will be readily salvageable after the dead have risen.

To ensure people are in the right mindset, the very first chapter does a bit of world building by explaining what life will be like when there is no more room in hell and discusses the different types of zombie one may encounter.

This is quickly followed by the first practical project - that of building a rechargeable solar battery. The justification for this is that the national grid is one of the first things to fail, and seeing as we've become somewhat reliant upon electricity in our modern world, it would be nice not to have to do without (that, and the fact the rest of the projects in the book also require some form of electricity).

The rest of the projects are based around further enhancing your chances of survival by doing things like powering lighting, building a zombie detector, and a whole bunch of other fun things.

And this is exactly what I mean by being able to motivate me - if you tell me we're going to build a rechargeable battery, and I'd have no interest - but tell me we're going to build a rechargeable battery because the hordes of the undead are just around the corner, and I'm falling over myself ready to get started.

I mean, it was enough of a lure that I'm not only committed to building all the projects contained within the book, but I'm also using this blog to keep track of my progress.
