<p class="intro"><em><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was around 7:30 in the morning when Lucy awoke. At first she was confused as to why her body would even consider consciousness at this early hour on a weekend.</em></p>

_She thought to herself "Are we going on Holiday today?" before remembering" No, we've only just got back from Cheddar"._

_So why was she awake?_

_She turned to Daniel, and as she uttered that oh-so frequent request/demand of "Coffee", a smile spread across her face._

_Today, she remembered, was the day we're adopting the cat._

------------------------------

The delightfully named Apricat is a beautiful ginger and white domestic short-haired that's believed to be around three years old.

She was a pregnant stray picked up by the RSPCA in Birmingham, and after giving birth to three kittens (all of whom were promptly adopted) she was initially denied the chance of adoption herself due to health issues. Thankfully she made a full recovery, and shortly after returning to [the adoption centre](http://www.rspca-worcester.org/) she met two very strange humans (that would be us).

The RSPCA operate a traffic light classification for all the animals in their care, and upon our first introduction she was classified as green (to indicate that she was friendly), but by our second meeting a week later, she had been downgraded to amber. 

Undeterred by this, we adopted her on 6th October 2018, and she's been slowly making herself at home since.

This hasn't been without it's issues, however, as in the early days and weeks of her life with this rebellious streak in her would flair up, resulting in many bites and scratches when we interacted with her.

It's this behaviour which lead to the creation of _Wildcat_, a small Arduino project designed to keep track of how long it's been since she last acted up.

(I'm going to talk more about this project in my next post).

Thankfully, since these early issues, she's chilled out a lot. Whereas before she'd spend all her time in the hallway, just outside the room we occupied, she's now found the confidence to come sit on the sofa next to us.

Allowing us to stroke her is still a privilege, not a right, but she's affording this privilege on a far more frequent basis. She's very vocal when it's time for dinner, and if we leave the bedroom door open, she'll inform us she wants feeding at 4:30 in the morning by jumping on the bed and wriggling.

We keep the door closed now.

Anyway, we're letting her outside for the first time tomorrow. So provided she comes back, I'll post about Project Wildcat next.

UPDATE: She came back in, [but then disaster struck](/2018/11/10/project-wildcat-has-been-delayed/).
